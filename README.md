## Development of Visual Recognition Model for Aztec Hieroglyphs.
This Google Sumer of Code project "Visual recognition and deciphering of Aztec glyphs using Keras" is contributed by Tarun Nagdeve with Red Hen Labs.
* Code Team: Tarun Nagdeve & Lisardo Pérez Lugones <br />
* Mentors: Stephanie Wood, Jungseock Joo & Juan José Batalla Rosado
### Project Description
This project aims to develop a recognition system that'll identify Aztec glyphs. Aztec is pictographic and ideographic photo-writing. It has no alphabets but different symbolic signs that have different meanings. The dataset currently consists of 1255 color images and growing. The dataset contains three types of images: Simplex, Compound, and Atomic images. As the name, suggests Simplex and Atomic contain simple and atomic images, respectively, and Compound images are the combination of simple and atomic ones. So the main task here would be creating a neural network that'll take in an image, compare it with the ones in our system, and finally give out the five most similar images matching with the input image. Here, we'll be using pre-trained Neural Networks for training our model, like MobileNet, InceptionV3, VGG16 and ResNet101 model. And finally, the trained model will be deployed online so that it's accessible easily.
